# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Segmented mall customers using K-Means clustering to identify distinct spending and income behavior for targeted marketing.

This project segments mall customers into distinct groups using K-Means clustering based on their annual income and spending scores. The goal is to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies to different customer profiles.

Overview

- Dataset: Mall Customer Segmentation (Gender, Age, Income, Spending Score)
- Techniques: K-Means Clustering, Scaling, 2D Cluster Visualization, Customer Profiling
- Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Key Findings

5 distinct clusters were identified, including:
  - High-income, low-spending (price-conscious)
  - Low-income, high-spending (impulse buyers)
  - High-income, high-spending (ideal target customers)
- Clusters 0 and 4 (low income but high spending) together account for over 60% of customers.
- High-income, low-engagement customers represent a missed opportunity.

 What I Learned

- How to apply unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means
- The importance of scaling data before clustering
- How to interpret and visualize cluster groups for business insights
